FILE BROWSING
=============

** NOTE: THIS IS NOT IN USE RIGHT NOW. I will come back to file browser later. **

Stories are stored in files, so we need a tool to find them.

My intent is to have file browser similar to e.g. Nautilus, that is, you can perform
all sorts of file operations with it. To be used to open and save files.

What features we need:

- Choosing files (for opening)
- Saving a file (giving a name and location for a saved file)
- Creating new file
- Creating folders
- Renaming files
- Deleting files
- Moving files
- Searching

In addition to work with local file systems, it would be great if it works with
all sorts of network storages (google drive, dropbox).
